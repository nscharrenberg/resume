description: '<p>As part of my Bachelor in Software Engineering, I worked as a Blockchain Intern in Curacao. During my internship, I conducted extensive research on the potential applications of Blockchain technology within the company&#039;s portfolio. I compiled my findings into an advisory report, highlighting innovative opportunities for the company to leverage Blockchain. Additionally, I developed a Blockchain-integrated prototype within an existing system, Sentoo, demonstrating practical applications of the technology. Throughout my internship, I also gained foundational knowledge in the BE-Informed low-code tool, enhancing my ability to create efficient and scalable solutions.</p>'
