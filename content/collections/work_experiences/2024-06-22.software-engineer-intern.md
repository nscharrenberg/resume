description: '<p>During my graduation internship at ATO-Gear, I focused on creating a conversational AI personal assistant for the Arion App, aimed at providing real-time feedback and personalized advice to users. My work involved performing in-depth research on Conversational AI technologies, including BERT models, wake-up words, and on-device NLP. Leveraging this research, I implemented a prototype of an offline, on-device conversational AI for mobile phones, specifically designed to be used while running. Additionally, I developed an administrative dashboard to effectively manage the back-end conversational AI system, ensuring seamless integration and functionality.</p>'
